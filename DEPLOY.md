# Deployment Guide

Since this is now a standalone **Vite Single Page Application (SPA)**, "running in production" means serving the static files generated by the build process.

## 1. Build the Project
First, generate the production-ready static files:
```bash
npm run build
```
This will create a `dist/public` folder containing your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## 2. Serving the App

### Option A: High-Performance Static Hosting (Recommended)
The easiest way to deploy is using a specialized frontend host.

**Vercel / Netlify / Cloudflare Pages:**
1. Connect your Git repository.
2. Use these settings:
   - **Build Command:** `npm run build`
   - **Output Directory:** `dist/public`
3. Deploy! The platform handles routing (falling back to index.html) and caching automatically.

### Option B: Node.js Static Server (Local Production)
If you want to run it on a VPS or locally to simulate production:

1. Install a static file server globally (or run with npx):
   ```bash
   npm install -g serve
   ```
2. Run the serve command pointing to your build output:
   ```bash
   serve -s dist/public -p 5000
   ```
   *The `-s` flag is critical—it ensures all routes (like `/contact`) fallback to `index.html` so client-side routing works.*

### Option C: Nginx / Apache
If deploying to a traditional web server, point your root to `dist/public`.

**Important for Nginx:**
You must configure try_files to prevent 404s on refresh:
```nginx
location / {
  root /path/to/Lab-Finder/dist/public;
  index index.html;
  try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html;
}
```

## 3. Environment Variables
Remember that in production, you cannot read `.env` files at runtime.
- **Vite Variables (`VITE_*`)**: These are **baked into the code** at build time.
- Ensure your build environment (Vercel, Github Actions, etc.) has `VITE_API_BASE_URL` set **before** running `npm run build`.
